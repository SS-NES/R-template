# R Project Template for Research Project

This R project template was generated using the meta template 
to streamline the adoption of best software development practices in the NES domain.

By leveraging the meta template, essential files that help a project adhere to the FAIR principles
such as licenses, CODEOFCONDUCT.md, README.md, 
and others were automatically included, eliminating the need for manual setup.
This also improves maintainability as updates such as changes in licenses can easily
be synced using copier update

## Purpose
This template is designed for R users working on data analysis, statistical 
modeling, or research projects. 
It provides a structured environment for easier maintability, readability and encourages reproducibility.

## Structural Adjustments
While adhering to NES best practices, the following modifications were made to tailor the template for R-based workflows:

- `R/` folder – Contains R scripts for functions and analyses.
- `data/` folder – Stores raw and processed datasets.
- `includes/` – Contains additional scripts or configuration files that support project execution.
- `man/` – Contains documentation for package functions, ensuring proper descriptions and metadata.
- `tests/` folder – Houses unit tests for R functions.
- `vignettes/` folder – Contains long-form documentation and examples 
using R Markdown to guide users in utilizing the project effectively.
